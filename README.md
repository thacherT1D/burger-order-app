# Burger Order App

A simple react app built to learn more about react and test features and libraries I'm interested in learning more about

### Decisions

- Use Storybook for quick feedback while building components
- Using useReducer and useContext hooks instead of Redux because this is a small application and using Redux is more than is required for this application

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start` runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test`
- `yarn build`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
